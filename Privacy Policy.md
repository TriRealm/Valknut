# 1. Overview & Acceptance of Policy
Valknut is a Discord moderation and utility bot. This Privacy Policy explains what information the bot collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

By using Valknut, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Privacy Policy and the accompanying [Terms of Service](https://github.com/TriRealm/Valknut/blob/main/Terms%20of%20Service.md)

---
# 2. Data Collection

**Valknut does not collect, sell, or permanently store personal data.**

The bot only processes limited technical information necessary to provide its functionality, such as:

**Guild configuration data:** roles, channels, and settings chosen by server administrators.

**Moderation metadata:** user IDs (non-personal/discord identifiers), timestamps, and action logs for moderation features (e.g., tempbans).

**Temporary anti-spam checks:** recent message data, automatically deleted after detection windows expire.

**Temporary moderation webhooks:** Valknut may send message logs via Discord webhooks for moderation purposes. These remain on Discord’s servers until deletion and are not stored by Valknut’s own systems.

**Ticket Data:** ticket messages and attachments are stored only while a ticket is open, deleted immediately upon closure after a transcript is delivered to the relevant server.

**Verification Data:** messages sent by users through Valknut’s verification system via DM are temporarily stored to facilitate moderation review and approval. Once the verification process is completed or expired, all related data is deleted from Valknut’s systems.

**Other DMs:**
Valknut does not read, log, or process any Direct Messages that are not part of the verification system.

---
# 3. Data Retention
Verification data is retained only until the review process concludes.

Ticket data is retained only while a ticket remains open.

Technical data (e.g., tempban expiry times) is automatically deleted once it is no longer required.

Configuration data is kept only as long as the bot remains in a server.

No long-term storage of user messages or private information occurs.

---
# 4. Data Sharing
Valknut does not share, sell, or disclose any data with third parties.

Verification and ticket data are used solely for server moderation purposes within the same guild and is not accessible to other guilds or the bot developers.

---
# 5. User Rights
Since Valknut does not store personal data, no user action is required to request data deletion. If configuration data should be removed, simply remove the bot from your server, which automatically deletes all stored settings.

---
# 6. Compliance
Valknut operates in compliance with:

[Discord Developer Terms of Service](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383-Discord-Developer-Terms-of-Service)

[Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)

Valknut relies solely on Discord’s API and hosting infrastructure for message delivery and temporary data storage.

This Privacy Policy may be updated as new features or legal requirements arise.
