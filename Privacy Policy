ðŸ“œ Privacy Policy for Valknut

Effective Date: 18/09/2025
Last Updated: 18/09/2025

1. Overview

Valknut is a Discord moderation and utility bot. This Privacy Policy explains what information the bot collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

2. Data Collection

Valknut does not collect or store personal data from users.
The bot only temporarily processes technical information necessary for its features:

Guild configuration data (roles, channels, and settings chosen by server admins).

Moderation metadata (user IDs, timestamps for temporary bans, logs of actions taken).

Temporary anti-spam checks (recent messages used only for spam detection and deleted after expiry).

The bot does not log or store private Direct Messages.

3. Data Retention

Technical data (e.g., tempban expiry times) is automatically deleted once it is no longer required.

Configuration data is kept only as long as the bot remains in a server.

No long-term storage of user messages or private information occurs.

4. Data Sharing

Valknut does not share, sell, or disclose any data with third parties.

5. User Rights

Since Valknut does not store personal data, no user action is required to request data deletion. If configuration data should be removed, simply remove the bot from your server, which automatically deletes all stored settings.

6. Compliance

This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with:

Discord Developer Terms of Service

Discord Community Guidelines

Privacy Policy is subject to update as needs arise for any future implementation of new features.
