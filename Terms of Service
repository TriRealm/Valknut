The bot does not read OR acknowledge private Direct Messages sent to it & it never logs, shares, or forwards private Direct Messages.

**Note:** Messages may be temporarily logged via Discord webhooks for moderation purposes, but these logs are not stored in Valknut’s databases.

This version explicitly clarifies temporary webhook logging, while leaving the rest of your Terms untouched.
If you want, I can also draft a shorter one-line addition to make it even more minimal and transparent. Do you want me to do that?
