## 1. Overview and Acceptance of Terms

Valknut is a moderation and utility bot for Discord. It provides tools for server administrators to manage their communities, including moderation actions, automated systems, and customizable configurations.

By inviting Valknut to your Discord server, being a member of a server that uses Valknut, or interacting with the bot in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to abide by these Terms of Service and the accompanying Privacy Policy.

**Server Owners and Administrators:** By inviting Valknut to your server, you confirm that you have the authority to do so and that you accept these Terms on behalf of your community. You are responsible for configuring and managing the bot within your server and ensuring that its use complies with Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and all applicable laws.

**Users:** By being in a server where Valknut is active or by directly using its commands, you agree not to abuse, exploit, or misuse its features. You must not attempt to circumvent moderation systems, rate limits, or any restrictions implemented by Valknut or Discord.

## 3. Data Usage

**Valknut does not permanently store personal user data.**

The bot only stores:

- Guild configurations (roles, channels, settings).

- Temporary technical data (user IDs, timestamps for tempbans, or anti-spam checks).

- Verification form responses and follow-ups (temporarily stored for moderation review by the staff of the server the verification is for).

- Open ticket messages (temporarily stored until the ticket is closed and logged in the server where the ticket was made).

**Temporary Data Handling:**

Verification responses sent via Direct Message (DM) are processed solely for moderation review.

These responses are stored only until verification is approved, denied, or otherwise resolved, at which point they are automatically deleted from Valknut’s databases.

Ticket messages are held only while a ticket is open; upon closure, the full transcript is exported to the server and deleted from Valknut’s systems.

Data is deleted automatically once it is no longer needed (e.g., after a ban expires).

Valknut never sells, shares, or permanently retains any user-submitted content.

It does not read, acknowledge, or process any other private Direct Messages unrelated to the verification system.

**Note:** Messages may be logged via Discord webhooks for moderation purposes by Valknut's Developers. These logs are stored in Discord and may persist until manually deleted. They are not stored in Valknut’s own databases.
