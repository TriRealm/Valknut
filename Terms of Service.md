## 1. Overview and Acceptance of Terms

Valknut is a moderation and utility bot for Discord. It provides tools for server administrators to manage their communities, including moderation actions, automated systems, and customizable configurations.

By inviting Valknut to your Discord server, being a member of a server that uses Valknut, or interacting with the bot in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to abide by these Terms of Service and the accompanying [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/TriRealm/Valknut/blob/main/Privacy%20Policy.md).

**Server Owners and Administrators:** By inviting Valknut to your server, you confirm that you have the authority to do so and that you accept these Terms on behalf of your community. You are responsible for configuring and managing the bot within your server and ensuring that its use complies with Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and all applicable laws.

**Users:** By being in a server where Valknut is active or by directly using its commands, you agree not to abuse, exploit, or misuse its features. You must not attempt to circumvent moderation systems, rate limits, or any restrictions implemented by Valknut or Discord.

You also agree not to use Valknut or any of its features in any way that the Valknut Development Team deems malicious, exploitative, or destructive to the Valknut Network or Discord’s platform integrity.

## 3. Data Usage

**Valknut does not store personal user data.**

The bot only stores:

- Guild configurations (roles, channels, settings).

- Temporary technical data (user IDs, timestamps for tempbans, or anti-spam checks).

Data is deleted automatically once it is no longer needed (e.g., after a ban expires).

The bot does not read OR acknowledge private Direct Messages sent to it & it never logs, shares, or forwards private Direct Messages.

**Note:** Messages may be logged via Discord webhooks for moderation purposes by Valknut's Developers. These logs are stored in Discord and may persist until manually deleted. They are not stored in Valknut’s own databases.
